# Flavor Text Generator

This is a simple flavor text generator that generates short sentences by combining a random verb from `verbs.txt` and a random noun from `nouns.txt`.

The generator works by taking a random verb from the `verbs.txt` file and appending "ing" to it. It then appends a random noun from the `nouns.txt` file to the end of the sentence. The resulting sentence is a randomly generated flavor text.

## Usage

To use the flavor text generator, simply clone the repository and run the `flavor_text.py` script. You can also modify the `verbs.txt` and `nouns.txt` files to customize the types of words used in the generator.

## Example Output

Here are a few examples of the type of flavor text that can be generated by the script:

- Exploding Potatoes of Doom
- Whipping Storm of Fury
- Spinning Blades of Carnage
- Burning Rain of Annihilation
